The project we will revisit the most in the course, this is a company website for Typographix. We will start off with a very simple version early in the course that will allow us to hone our skills in typography with Google Fonts, dark mode functionality, and lastly, responsive design. In the climax of the course, we will remake the project from scratch to incorporate SCSS architecture, including variables, nesting, mixins, and control directives, as well as optimizing our media, learning some techniques to trigger transitions and animations when a section scrolls into view, contact form functionality, and responsive design!
